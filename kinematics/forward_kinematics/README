Name:         forward_kinematics
Maintainers:  Sisir K and Maurice F
Summary:      Provides i) a ROS style tf publisher ii) a library for performing full forward kinematics using the KDL library. This gene
Description:
  FILL-ME-IN

Requirements: 
 urdf orocos-kdl kdl-parser 

Description:

The main component of this pod is the forward-kinematics library
1) forward-kinematics library:
This library extende the KDL library and it contains a solver class defined in treefksolverposfull_recursive.cpp. 
This class thats provides a JntToCart routine to solve forward kinematics for the whole kinematic structure. 
KDL library functions only provide an interface to query global position between a specified root and a tip segment.

In addition, three sample programs are provided that illustrate the functionality of above library. 

1) robot_tf_publisher:
Subscribes to MEAS_JOINT_ANGLES lcm channel to get joint angles and then 
publishes them as ROS style tf_t messages on JOINT_TRANSFORMS and FIXEDJOINT_TRANSFORMS lcm channels.
The publisher requires access to the urdf robot model. 
At startup, the process creates a subcription to ROBOT_MODEL lcm channel,
waits until it receives the urdf string and then unsubcribes from this
channel.

2) robot_tf_listener:
This is a example program that subscribes to tf_t messages published on the 
JOINT_TRANSFORMS channels.
For an example usage, try the following commands in a set of terminals in the specified order:

Term1: ./robot_tf_listener
Term2: ./robot_tf_publisher
Term3: ./meas_joint_angles_publisher (requires the sensing/meas_joint_angles_publisher pod)
Term4: ./broadcast_robot_model atlas_robot.urdf (requires the robot_model/robot_model_publisher pod)

3) test_forward_kinematics_solver
This is a example program that subscribes to JOINT_STATES lcm channel to get joint angles
and then shows example usage of the JntToCart routine provided in the forward-kinematics 
SHARED library. At startup, the process creates a subcription to ROBOT_MODEL lcm channel,
waits until it receives the urdf string and then unsubcribes from this
channel.

For an example usage, try the following commands in a set of terminals in the specified order:

Term1: ./test_forward_kinematics_solver
Term2: ./meas_joint_angles_publisher (requires the sensing/meas_joint_angles_publisher pod)
Term3: ./broadcast_robot_model atlas_robot.urdf (requires the robot_model_publisher pod)
